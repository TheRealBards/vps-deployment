# Virtual Private Server (VPS) Deployment
A script for automated deployment of a VPS. My VPS of choice is Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial LTS (Server).

## Usage 
```
git clone https://github.com/TheRealBards/vps-deployment.git
chmod +x vps-deployment/vps-deployment.sh
sudo vps-deployment/vps-deployment.sh "<SSH Public Key>"
```

## Recommendations
* It's always recommended to go through a script before running anything with `sudo` to make sure you're happy with what it's doing.

## Warning
* Whilst this works for me, it might not for you.
* There might be some bugs, there might not - use at your own risk.
